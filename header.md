# Joe's Public To-do List
As part of a commitment to personal transparency I’m making my personal to-do list publicly and permanently accessible here.

You can read about the reasons why and the benefits at the [blog post I did](http://joereddington.com/6232/2016/08/26/my-to-do-list-is-now-public-and-its-the-most-useful-thing-ive-done-in-years./). 

In order, the columns are: Completed; Priority; Expected Time; Action Point; and Deadline.  Deadline defaults to being 7 days but can change. 

Lower numbers mean higher priority, and they are assigned based on something that is important to me, which is integrity. You can read more about prioritisation [at this blog post](http://joereddington.com/6384/2017/03/19/making-your-priority-list-actually-work./). 

As a shorthand, the levels are these: 

0. not known, might be very very important, must sort
1. “Send James the new slides they need” – actions that I have committed to and that a named person needs before they can do something, with a deadline.
2. “Send James the book he asked for” – actions that I have committed to and that a named person needs before they can do something, but that don’t have a specific deadline.
3. “Register for Saturday fun run”: actions that have a deadline and I have said I will do (to at least one person or in public), but only I care about.
4. “Go running” Like 3, but without a hard deadline.
5. “Make doctors appointment” actions I have promised myself, or I feel make me the person I like being
6. “See if you can make a cup holder from wood”  ‘play’ things.
